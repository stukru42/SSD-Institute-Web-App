    <h1>Minimum Amount of Space</h1>
    <p>
        <strong>Definition:</strong> Minimum Amount of Space guarantees every citizen an inalienable, untaxed plot of land based on a specific mathematical formula. 
        This land is allocated from private holdings or federal reserves and cannot be sold or seized, ensuring a fundamental right to exist. 
        The concept aims to replace traditional welfare with tangible independence and long-term stability for every individual.
    </p>
    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>
        Each citizen is entitled to a plot of land calculated using the formula: (average height × 3)² square feet
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, if the average height of a population is 5 feet, the calculation would be: (5 × 3)² = 15² = 225 square feet. 
        This plot of land is sufficient for a small dwelling and personal use, providing a basic level of security and self-sufficiency. 
        The land is allocated from existing private holdings or federal reserves, ensuring that it does not require additional government expenditure.
    </p>
    <p>
        Citizens who already own property can designate a portion of their current land as their "Minimum Space." Once designated, this specific footprint becomes exempt from property taxes and is shielded from seizure by creditors or the state.
    </p>
    <p>
        Those without property receive their allocation from federal reserves, such as Bureau of Land Management (BLM) land.
    </p>
    <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
    <p>
        The current welfare state relies on liquid capital and bureaucratic distribution, which can be volatile and dehumanizing. 
        By providing a tangible asset in the form of land, Minimum Amount of Space offers a more stable and dignified form of support.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because the land cannot be sold, seized, or taxed, it remains a permanent safety net. 
        Even in the event of total financial collapse, a citizen retains the right to stand on, sleep on, and live on their own soil.
    </p>
    <p>
        This concept promotes self-sufficiency and independence, allowing individuals to cultivate their land for food, shelter, or other needs without reliance on government assistance. 
    </p>
    <p>
        It bridges the gap between the land-owning class and the landless, ensuring that the nation's geography is shared equitably among its people.
    </p>
    <h2>Visualization & Implementation Plan</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Static Example: </strong> A map showing the distribution of Minimum Space plots across a city or region, highlighting how the land is allocated and utilized by citizens.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Future Simulation: </strong> Treemap or cartogram illustrating how land is divided among citizens, with toggles for state/federal/private land assumptions.
        This interactive visualization would allow users to see how the Minimum Space concept would function in different scenarios, such as varying population densities or land availability.
