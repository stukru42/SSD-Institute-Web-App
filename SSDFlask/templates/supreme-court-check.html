    <h1>Supreme Court Veto</h1>
    <p>
        <strong>Definition:</strong> The Supreme Court Veto introduces a democratic check on judicial power by allowing a simple majority of states to reject a ruling. 
        If 26 or more states object, the decision no longer applies nationwide, returning the authority to individual states to set their own policies. 
        This model balances federal judicial oversight with state autonomy and direct accountability to citizens.
    </p>
    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>
        When the Supreme Court issues a ruling, it is subject to a "State Validation Period." 
        During this time, each state legislature can vote to accept or reject the decision. 
        If 26 or more states formally object, the ruling is effectively nullified at the federal level. 
        The issue then becomes a matter of state law, allowing each state to determine its own approach based on local values and preferences.
    </p>
    <p>
        Using a simple majority threshold (26 out of 50 states) ensures that the veto power is accessible and can be exercised without requiring an overwhelming consensus, while still providing a significant check on judicial authority.
        It prevents a few high population states from dominating the national legal landscape, ensuring that the voices of smaller states are also heard in the judicial process.
    </p>
    <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
    <p>
        It introduces a democratic check on judicial power, ensuring that the Supreme Court's decisions reflect the will of the people as expressed through their state governments.
    </p>
    <p>
        By allowing states the power to reject a Supreme Court ruling, it promotes a more balanced federal system where states have greater autonomy to govern according to their unique cultural and political landscapes.
    </p>
    <p>
        This model encourages state governments to be more responsive to their constituents, as they would have a direct role in shaping the legal landscape of their state in response to federal judicial decisions.
    </p>
    <h2>Visualization & Implementation Plan</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Static Example: </strong> A static map of the United States showing which states accepted or rejected a hypothetical Supreme Court ruling.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Future Simulation: </strong> An interactive map showing the real-time status of a Supreme Court ruling as states vote to accept or reject it.
        (once 26 states object, a "Veto Achieved" indicator appears)
